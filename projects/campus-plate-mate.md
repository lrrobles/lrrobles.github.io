For the final project in my ICS 314 Software Engineering class taken in Spring 2025, five other people and I have developed a web application called "Campus Plate Mate". It is a platform where UH Manoa community members can give out their unwanted or excess food to other community members in need. The goal of Campus Plate Mate is to reduce food waste on the UH Manoa campus as it can be very prevalent, and we wanted to provide a platform where UH Manoa community members can interact with each other regarding their food or waste-reducing needs.

My biggest contributions to the project are the "Sign In/Up" page, where it acts as a slider form and you can choose whether you want to sign in or sign up (create an account), as well as the "Dashboard" page, where the posts by users are shown as cards. The slider form was requested by my fellow group mate and is from [here](https://codepen.io/FlorinPop17/pen/vPKWjd), while the Dashboard page reads from a database where it reads the posts created by users.

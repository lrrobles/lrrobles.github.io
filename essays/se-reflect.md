## Agile Project Management 

One of the things I learned about software engineering is a project management style called Agile Project Management, which some characteristics include:

* Fixed-length iterations/releases
* Deliver business value early
* Continuous, adaptive planning
* Emergent feature discovery
* Continuous testing

This is a style that is well suited to small groups with easy access to customers for small projects. 

To dig a little deeper, the specific style of Agile Project Management that we activitely used in our assignments is called Issue Driven Project Management.

# Issue Driven Project Management

Issue Driven Project Management statisfies the characteristics listed previously regarding Agile Project Management while also having its own set of rules:

* Divide the work into tasks
* No task will take longer than three days
* Each task is specified by an issue
* Each issue has a single owner
* Issues are organized into Milestones
* Milestones have due dates
* Milestones are represented by Project Boards
* At all times, every person has at least one issue that they are responsible for closing

Looking at these rules, I think it is pretty easy to apply this style of project management in things that do not involve web applications. For example, if my friend and I wanted to develop a game heavily inspired by Flappy Bird, then applying Issue Driven Project Management would look something like this: Milestone 1 would deal with the visuals first, where you first settle on the "pipes" and the "bird". In this Milestone, my friend would be assigned to the "pipes" and I would be assigned to the "bird" or vice versa. On Milestone 2, the person responsible for the "pipes" would not allow the "bird" to collide on to the "pipes", and if it did, the game would end. The person responsible for the "bird" would have to figure out how to allow the player to move it, and maybe show some sort of score accumulation on the screen. If there was a hypothetical "customer" involved in this project, they could simply request things such as, "Oh, can the bird be a flying pig instead?" or "Change the sound when the bird passes through the pipe!".

As the small-scale project continues development, you could see how Issue Driven Project Management simplifies things for the developer and for the customer.

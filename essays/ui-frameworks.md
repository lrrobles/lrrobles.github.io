## My Experience Thus Far

One of the things I noticed during this UI Frameworks module is that I think it is particularly important to be able to visualize what you want to create. To give an example in Bootstrap, it is being able to map out the "rows" and "columns" in your head, and within those subsections, knowing what you want to put in them. 

When talking about comparisons between raw HTML and CSS to Bootstrap, I think one of the key differences is that there is not as much styling as there is in HTML and CSS. I found it quite nice that I did not have to worry as much about styling in Bootstrap compared to HTML and CSS. Though, one glaring problem I had with Bootstrap is that when the WODs (Workout-of-the-Day s) got more difficult, most of my time was spent looking at the documentation rather than coding, but I guess that was a given since I am new to using Bootstrap.

Maybe the real reason why I am not a fan at looking at the official documentation is that I DNFed on the WODs where I felt like I was just looking at documentation 90% of the time!

Jokes aside, it does seem like once I become more experienced using Bootstrap, it will be more easier to create webpages with it compared to HTML and CSS.

## What About Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS As A Whole?

When learning Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS, I liked how it was more like learning how to use tiny building blocks one-by-one in order to create webpages. I think this is different compared to the typical coding languages such as Java, C, TypeScript, etc.. Since they are not related in that sense, it teaches me how to think in a block-by-block style, and thus expands my software engineering/programming knowledge as a whole.

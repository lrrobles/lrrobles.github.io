## A Reflection

Personally, I think having coding standards to follow is a nice way to keep a consistent level of quality for your programs. Not only will it be nice to look at, but it will also be easier for other programmers or software engineers to understand the code in order for them to tweak and or add on to it. Imagine the joy of a potential employer when they see someone that can write quality programs. So yes, you heard it here first: coding standards will get you a job. <sub> Not to be taken super seriously. </sub> 

Aside from the visual aspect, coding standard tools being able to detect and remove generic coding mistakes will just make the life of the programmer easier. They can worry less about making those mistakes and mainly put their focus on getting their program to work the way they want it too.

Even though these are great positives, I do not think that coding standards can help you learn a new programming language. In my opinion, one of the most important things you can know to help you learn a new programming language is knowing the step-by-step process needed to reach your result, _regardless_ of programming language. Once you know this, learning a new language comes down to looking up the syntax online (at least in my inexperienced opinion). The part where coding standards come in, the nice-looking code, will come naturally as you learn what your program does in-depth, but it is separate from your learning of the language.

When talking about my own experiences, as of typing this, I need to double-check that I am using ESLint correctly. (I know right. "What?!")

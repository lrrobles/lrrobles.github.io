## II. Personal Experience with AI:

1. Experience WODs
I did not use AI when doing the experience WODs because I felt like it would defeat the purpose of learning the content if I were to use it.

2. In-class Practice WODs
I did not use AI when doing the in-class practice WODs because I felt like it would defeat the purpose of learning the content if I were to use it.

3. In-class WODs
I did not use AI when doing the in-class practice WODs because I felt like it would defeat the purpose of learning the content of I were to use AI. Though in the end, I ended up getting a DNF for the majority of the WODs in the semester. I do not regret it because I did not see the point of using AI to do the WOD for me since I will not learn anything at the end, I also knew beforehand that the grade will not make me feel better, and that is speaking from a previous experience.

4. Essays
I did not use AI when writing any of the essays because to me, essays (in this context) are a way to get YOUR own words and thoughts to the world, and using AI defeats that purpose, since AI is not you. I also see essays as a way to flex how you put words on paper for others to see, and that itself is a challenge because you would want others to understand what you are trying to say.

5. Final Project
The final project is the first and last instance I decided to use AI in the semester. In my group's Campus Plate Mate Project, I was tasked to do the sign in page, and my group member wanted me to do a slider form that contains both the sign in and sign up functionality. The code given to me by my group mate was complicated, in my opinion, and since I was in a time crunch to do it, I decided to use ChatGPT. In ChatGPT, I basically posted the link to the slider form and asked it to implement it in React Bootstrap. Looking back at it now, I still think that was so bad and made me feel really guilty. I did not learn anything as I just copy and pasted without trying to understand the code it was giving me. The only benefit I gained is that it saved me a lot of time and and reduced my stress levels. But is not using my critical thinking skills worth it? I do not think so.

6. Learning a Concept / Tutorial
I did not use AI when learning concepts or doing a tutorial because I felt like it would defeat the purpose of learning the content if I were to use it.

7. Answering a Question in Class or in Discord
The questions I would answer in Discord are questions that are asked by my group members in our personal team chat for the Final Project. When answering, I would answer with only the knowledge I know, and if I needed to look up something real quick, I would either reference my own work from previous assignments, look at the solution videos of the experience WODs, or look at a forum post from something like StackOverflow. No AI used due to the same reasons stated previously.

8. Asking ot Answering a Smart-Question
I did not ask or answer a queestion in the smart-questions channel in the Discord so this sub-section does not apply to me.

9. Coding Example
I did not use AI when asking for code examples because I felt like it would defeat the purpose of learning if I were to use it.

10. Explaining Code
I did not use AI to explain code for me because I felt like it would defeat the purpose of learning the content if I were to use it. Though, I am near-constantly reasoning with myself that I should maybe use AI to tell or explain to me, "What does ____ do in this line of code here?" , since I am not exactly asking AI to do someting for me, but trying to use it as a resource to help me understand the material.

11. Writing the Code
I did not use AI to write code for me because I felt like it would defeat the purpose of learning the content if I were to use it.

12. Documenting Code
I did not use AI to document code because I felt like it would defeat the purpose of learning how to if I were to use it. And admittedly, I did not do as much code documentation as I should have.

13. Quality Assurance
I did not use AI for quality assurance because I felt like the things VSCode and ESLint were doing by default were good enough.

14. Other Uses in ICS 314 Not Listed
I rarely used AI in ICS 314, so nothing.
